                <p>
                    The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing
                    river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and
                    warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children
                    who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                <p>
                    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the 
                    Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
                    beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. Desolation Canyon 
                    has been recognized as a National Landmark, based on its uniqueness and rich history.

                <p>
                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will
                    never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. It combines world-class whitewater with 
                    breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is 
                    filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient 
                    indian ruins accessible only by river.

                        <strong>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however 
                                that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents 
                                especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).

                        <strong>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?
                        </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk.
                                To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid
                                and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. Everyone on commercial
                                rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device 
                                (PFD).

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, 
                                waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and 
                                camping chair. We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate
                                are provided during the morning and evening hours.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If
                                you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.
